## concept of a random variable

- it is often important to allocate a numerical description to the outcome of a statistical experiment
- for a given sample space $S$ of some experiment, a random variable (rv) is any rule that associates a number with each outcome in $S$.

### definition 3.1

**a random variable is a function that associates a real number with each element in the sample space**

- the function's domain is the sample space and it's range is the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$
- one and only one numerical value is assigned to each sample point x
- random variables are customarily denoted by upper case letters $X, Y, Z, \dots$
- we use lowercase letters to represent some particular value of the corresponding random variable
- the notation $X(\omega) = x$ means that $x$ is the value associated with the outcome $s$ by the rv $X$
