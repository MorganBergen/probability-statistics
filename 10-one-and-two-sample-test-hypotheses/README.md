##  statistical hypothesis general concepts

-  instead of making an estimate about a population parameter, youll learn how to test a claim about a parameter

-  **example** suppose that you work for gallup and are asked to test a claim that $68\%$ of americans approve biden's performance as a nation's chief executive.  to test the claim, you take a random sample of n = 1200 eligible voters and find 780 of them support joe biden.  you sample statistic is $\hat{p} = 0.65$

-  **question**  is the sample statistic identical enough to your claim $p = 0.68$ to decide that the claim is true, or different enough from the claim $p = 0.68$ to decide that the claim is false?

-  **example**  a medical researcher may decide on the basis of experimental evidence <p style="color: #FFA500; filter: saturate(2) brightness(1.2) hue-rotate(10deg);">whether coffee drinking increases the risk of cancer in humans.</p>

-  **example**  an engineer might have to decide on the basis of sample data <p style="color: #FFA500; filter: saturate(2) brightness(1.2) hue-rotate(10deg);">whether there is a difference between the accurary of two kinds of gauges.</p>

-  **example** a sociologist might wish to collect appropriate data to enable him or her to decide <p style="color: #FFA500; filter: saturate(2) brightness(1.2) hue-rotate(10deg);">whether a person's blood type and eye color are independent variables</p>

-  in each of these casess the scientist of engineer postulates or conjectures something about a system.  in addition, each must involve the use of experimental data and decision makuing that is based on the data.  

-  **definition 10.1**  a statistical hypothesis is an assertion or conjecture concerning one or more populations.

-  we take a random sample from the population of interest and use the data contained in this sample to provide evidence that either supports or does not support the the hypothesis. evidence from the sample that is inconsistent with the stated hypothesis leads to a rejection of the hypothesis.

-  the rejection of a hypothesis implies that the sample evidence refutes it.  put another way, rejection means that there is a small probability of obtaining the sample infomration observed when, in fact, the hypothesis is true.

##  null hypothesis h0 and alternative hypothesis h1

-  null hypothesis is what we wish to test and is denoted by $H_{0}$.  it is the status quo and usually states nothing is different or nothing changed.  e.g. $H_{0}: \theta = \theta_{0}$

-  the alternative hypothesis $H_{1}$ or $H_{A}$
