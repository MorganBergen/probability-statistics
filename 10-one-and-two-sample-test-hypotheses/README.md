##  statistical hypothesis general concepts

-  instead of making an estimate about a population parameter, youll learn how to test a claim about a parameter
-  **example** suppose that you work for gallup and are asked to test a claim that $68\%$ of americans approve biden's performance as a nation's chief executive.  to test the claim, you take a random sample of n = 1200 eligible voters and find 780 of them support joe biden.  you sample statistic is $\hat{p} = 0.65$
-  **question**  is the sample statistic identical enough to your claim $p = 0.68$ to decide that the claim is true, or different enough:wq
