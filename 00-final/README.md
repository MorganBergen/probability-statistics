2.95    in a certain region of the country it is known from past experience that the probability of selecting an adult over 40 years of age with cancer is 0.05. if the probability of a doctor correctly diagnosing a person with cancer as having the disease is 0.78 and the probability of incorrectly diagnosing a person without cancer as having the disease is 0.06, what is the probability that an adult over 40 years of age is diagnosed as having cancer?

2.115   a certain federal agency employs three con- sulting firms (A, B, and C) with probabilities 0.40, 0.35, and 0.25, respectively. from past experience it is known that the probability of cost overruns for the firms are 0.05, 0.03, and 0.15, respectively. suppose a cost overrun is experienced by the agency.

a.  what is the probability that the consulting firm involved is company C?

b.  what is the probability that it is company A?

2.120   a rare disease exists with which only 1 in 500 is affected. a test for the disease exists, but of course it is not infallible. a correct positive result (patient actually has the disease) occurs 95% of the time, while a false positive result (patient does not have the disease) occurs 1% of the time. If a randomly selected individual is tested and the result is positive, what is the probability that the individual has the disease?
