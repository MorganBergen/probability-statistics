## what is statistics

- statistics is a way to get information from data
- statistics means numerical descriptions to most people
- statistics is a discipline which is concerned with:
    - designing experiements and data collection
    - summarizing information to aid understanding
    - analyzing and drawing conclusions from data
    - estmating the present or predicting the future
- in making predictions, statistics used the companion subject of probability, which models chance mathematically and enables calculations of change in complicated cases

## inferential statistics

- inferential statistics are the mathematical procedures hereby we convert information about the sample into intelligent guesses about the population

- it utilizes sample data to make estimates, decisions, predictions, or other generalizations about larger set of data

- this is also called inductive reasoning or inductive statistics
    - deduction - from the general facts to partiulcar cases:  mathematics
    - induction - from a particular case to a general one:  statistics

## descriptive statistics

- descriptive statistics consists of methods for organizing displaying, and describing data to convey information by using tables, graphs, and summary measure
- descriptive statistics are just descriptive. they do not involve generalizing beyond the data at hand.
- it utilizes graphical and numerical methods to look at patterns, to summarize, and to present the information in a set of data
- other involve calculation of numerical summary measures such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients
- software:  calcular, r, sas, spss, stata,...
- with descriptive statistics, we are simply describing what the data shows
- with inferential statsitics, we are trying to make inferences from our data to more general conditions

## role of probability

- for a statistical problem, the sample along with inferential statistics allow us to draw conclusions about the population, with inferential statistics making clear use of elements of probability. (inductive in nature)
- for a probability problem we can draw conclusions about characteristics of hypothetical data taken from the population based on known features of the population (deductive in nature)

**fundamental relationship between probability and inferential statistics**
```
         --------- probability ---------
        |                               |
    population                        sample    
        |                               |
         ---------- statistics ---------    

```
- the procedure involves two different jobs, thos are
    1.  to estimate a parameter of the population through sample
    2.  testing hypotheses or conjectures/claims about the parameter

## data collection and sampling procedures

- statistics deals not only with the organization and analysis of data once it has been collected but also with the development of techniques for collecting the data
- data not properly collected may be useless and misleading
- appropriate sampling scheme must be used
    - simple random sample:  any particular sample of a specified sample size has the same chance of being selected as any other sample of the same size
    - stratified random sample

## pictorial and tabular methods in descriptive statistics
visual representation of data is a powerful tool for understanding data, some examples are:

1. stem-and-leaf display

2. dotplots

3. histograms

4. boxplots

5. frequency tables

6. pie charts

7. bar graphs

8. scatterplots

### stem-and-leaf display

- a stemp and leaf plot, a combined tabular and graphic display, can be used to study the behavior of the mass statistical data
    - split each observation into 2 parts: stem and leaf
        - stem can be the digit preceding the decimal point
        - leaf can be the digit after the decimal point
    - make a table:  list the stem values as rows and ahh each leaf value with a specific stem value to that row

**example**  the following table show the life of 40 car batteries

```
2.2 4.1 3.5 4.5 3.2 3.7 3.0 2.6 
3.4 1.6 3.1 3.3 3.8 3.1 4.7 3.7 
2.5 4.3 3.4 3.6 2.9 3.3 3.9 3.1 
3.3 3.1 3.7 4.4 3.2 4.1 1.9 3.4 
4.7 3.8 3.2 2.6 3.9 3.0 4.2 3.5
```

<p style="color:blue;">stem (integer part) -and-leaf (decimal part) plot of battery life</p>

| stem | leaf          | frequency |
|:---- |:--------------|:----------|
| 1    | 69            | 2         |
| 2    | 25669         | 5         |
| 3    | 0011112223334445567778899 | 25 |
| 4    | 11234577      | 10        |

### dotplots

- there are two sample from separate populations.  the purpose is to determine if the use of the nitorgen has an influence on the growth of the roots
- in the **dot plot** 
    - â—‹ - the "nitrogen" data
    - x - the "no-nitrogen" data
- the data suggest on average the use of nitrogen increases the stem weight.  most of the no-nitrogen observations appear to be below the center of the data.  thus it indicates that nitrogen is effective.

| no-nitrogen | nitrogen |
|:------------|:---------|
0.32 | 0.26 | 
0.53 | 0.43 |  
0.28 | 0.47 | 
0.37 | 0.49 | 
0.47 | 0.52 | 
0.43 | 0.75 | 
0.36 | 0.79 | 
0.42 | 0.86 | 
0.38 | 0.62 |
0.43 | 0.46 |

### histograms

- by rotating a stem-and-leaf plot counter clockwise through an angle of 90 degrees, the resulting columns of leaves form a picture that is similar to a histogram
- as the sample size becomes larger, the frequency histogram would approach a bell-shaped continuous probability distribution

## measures of location

- location measure in data set provide the analyst some quantitative measure of where the **data center** is in a sample mean.

- one obvious measure is the sample mean (mathematical average), which is simply a numerical average.

- the sample median is to reflect the central tendency of the sample and is uninfluenced by extreme values.

- suppose that the observations in a smple are $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \cdots, x_{n}$, the sample mean denoted $\bar{x}$

**sample mean**

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n} = \frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + \cdots + x_{n}}{n} $$

sensitive to outliers (or extreme values)

- sample median-middle value in the observations of ordered data set.  It divides a data set into two equal parts, denoted by $\tilde{x}$

**if $n$ is even**

$$ \tilde{x} = \frac{x_{\frac{n+1}{2}} + x_{\frac{n+2}{2}}}{2} $$

**if $n$ is odd**

$$ \tilde{x} = x_{\frac{n+1}{2}} $$

**example**

- a sample of n = 12 recording Beethovens Symphony #9, yielding the following durations (min) listed in increasing order is as follows

- 62.3 62.8 63.6 65.2 65.7 66.4 67.4 68.4 68.8 70.8 75.7 79.0

- the sample mean is 68.01

- the sample median is the average of the $n/2 = 6\text{th}$ and $n/2 + 1 = 7\text{th}$ observations

## measures of variability

- population parameters include the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the population.  
- mean is denoted by $\mu$
- standard deviation is denoted by $\sigma$

## discrete and continuous data

## general types of statistical studies
